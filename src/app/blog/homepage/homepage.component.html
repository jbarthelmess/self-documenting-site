<h1>Welcome to the Self Documenting Blog!</h1>
<p>The purpose of this blog/website is to document the learning experience 
    of creating and building a personal website and tracking my learning 
    process along the way. The timeline of creation will be tracked by blog
    posts that I create. In that way it is "self documenting". This blog is
    written in Angular, because that's what I know to get started.
